# Twitter Proxy

A simple Node.js application that starts a web server to proxy Javascript requests to the Twitter v1.1 API.

## Instructions:

    cd twitter-proxy && npm install
    node start

Your app should now be running on localhost:5000.

You can also deploy this code easily on Heroku or other similar hosting providers.

## API Endpoints:

See [Twitter's API documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1) and simply change the hostname to the hostname of your running app.
